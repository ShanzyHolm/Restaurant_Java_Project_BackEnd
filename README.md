CodeClan Week-long Group Project 3 - Java Restaurant App has a back-end built in IntelliJ using Spring.  It is a restaurant booking system which enables employees to take phone bookings, track customers and their bookings, create new customers and bookings and edit both of them as well.  It uses Java and contains packages, classes, interfaces, stateless components, repositories, and projections.  It is accessed through localhost:8080 as JSON objects.
